            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement,
            </i><sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness,</i><sup>[2]</sup><i>or 
            inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>)</i> is a phenomenon observed 
            in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup>The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
            the same species,but also occurs between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup>There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might 
            inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup>The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses 
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
