        <h4> SYNOPIS</h4>
        <p>
            It's a hot summer on Amity Island, a small community whose primary 
            business is its beaches. When new Police Chief Martin Brody 
            discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first 
            inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. It doesn't sit well 
            with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several local business people. Brody 
            backs down to his regret of that weekend. A predator kills a young 
            boy. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark, and Amity 
            is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fishermen hoping to cash in 
            on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting 
            sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee.
            Soon, Quint, Brody, and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic 
            Institute are hunting the Great White shark at sea. 
            As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter 
            with the creature, they will need a bigger boat.

        <h4> SYNOPIS</h4>
        <p>
            Death stalks the dreams of several young adults to claim its revenge 
            on the killing of Freddy Kruger. Chased and chastised by this 
            finger-bladed demon, it is the awakening of old memories and the 
            denials of a past of retribution that spurns this hellish vision of 
            dreamlike state and turns death into a nightmare reality

            phenomenon at everyone's whim.

        <h4> SYNOPIS</h4>
        <p>
            A group of young adults set up tent near the abandoned summer camp 
            where a series of gruesome murders are said to have taken place 
            back in 1980. The perpetrator was a grieving mother, driven insane 
            by the drowning of her child, Jason, whom she believed was neglected 
            by the camp counselors. As legend has it, the last survivor of the 
            attacks beheaded the woman. But then Jason came back, and now he is 
            a vengeful and inexorable killer, wielding crossbows, swords, axes 
            and other sharp instruments. The legend proves horribly true, as 
            these campers quickly discover.
