                Freddy vs. Jason, is a 2003 American slasher movie. Directed 
                by Ronny Yu, it is a crossover film combining two of the most 
                successful horror franchises. It is also known as Friday the 
                13th Part XI and A Nightmare on Elm Street 8. In the series 
                continuity of both franchises, this comes after Jason Goes to 
                Hell: The Final Friday and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. 
                The film would wind up being the highest grossing feature 
                throughout the history of either character villain, and is 
                the final film in the original series of both the Nightmare 
                and Friday movies and in the original timeline. Afterward, 
                the franchises returned as reboots/remakes in 2009's Friday 
                the 13th and 2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street.

            <h2> The Plot</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                After four years, Freddy Krueger is trapped in Hell. 
                The town of Springwood has forgotten about him, robbing him 
                of his power. He finds Jason Voorhees, disguises himself as 
                Jason's mother, Pamela Voorhees and brings him back to life, 
                telling him to kill some people on Elm Street. If enough fear 
                is spread by Jason, Freddy will come back.

            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                Meanwhile, Jason goes to Lori Campbell's house (where Nancy and 
                Jesse used to live) where Lori, Kia, Gibb, Blake, and Trey are. 
                Trey is Gibb's boyfriend and Kia wants Lori and Blake to be 
                together which Lori doesn't like. After a while, Jason kills 
                Trey and the police think that Freddy was the one who killed 
                him. One of them mentions Freddy's name while Lori and Blake 
                both hear the name.            
            </p>

                At the police station, Lori falls asleep and is stalked by 
                Freddy, but he's not strong enough to kill her yet. When 
                Freddy attempts to kill Blake in his dream, his claw goes 
                right through him without harming him at all. When Blake 
                wakes up, he finds his father got his head cut off. After 
                that, Jason kills Blake as well.

            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                All the kids who made contact with Freddy were placed in 
                Westin Hills where they are given Hypnocil to prevent them 
                from dreaming. Among them are Mark Davis and Lori's boyfriend 
                Will Rollins. Will saw Lori's dad (which it was Freddy and Will 
                did not know it was him at the time) kill Lori's mother.

                The next morning, the police blame the murders on Blake and say 
                that he committed suicide after killing his father and Trey. 
                Kia didn't believe them, and knows that they're lying. After 
                Lori tells Kia and Gibb about her nightmare, Mark show up and 
                tells Lori (and all the students) all about Freddy. Will comes 
                and tells Mark to stop scaring Lori. Lori who is shocked from 
                seeing Will passes out. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-padding">
                After the boys leave the school, Mark tells Will that 
                Springwood covered up Freddy's existence and that everyone who 
                made contact with him was locked up in Westin Hills, so no one 
                else could get hurt or killed. At night, Mark realizes that he 
                screwed up the town's plans by spreading enough fear about 
                Freddy. At the Cornfield, Lori and the teenagers are having 
                fun until Gibb falls asleep and is attacked by Freddy. Before 
                Freddy can kill her, Jason kills her, along with a glowing 
                raver who was going to rape Gibb in the real world.
