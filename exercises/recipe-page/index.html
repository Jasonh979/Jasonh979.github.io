        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounce package brownie mix (I used Ghirardelli)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1  cup crumbled graham crackers</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>hot fudge sauce, optional</li>          

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <li>
                Prepare the brownie batter according to package directions but 
                instead of water, substitute with equal parts whole milk. 
                Add the milk, egg, and vegetable oil to the brownie mix and use 
                a rubber spatula to incorporate until you have a thick batter 
                consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                To a food processor, add the graham crackers and blend until you 
                have a sand-like consistency. Transfer to a bowl, add the melted 
                butter, and mix together well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a non-stick cupcake tray, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the 
                graham cracker mix to each cup. Press down well to form a 
                crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a dollop of brownie batter on top so each cup is now around 
                2/3 full to the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the 
                brownies are set in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a spoon or any small round surface like your finger to make 
                a small indent in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a few mini marshmallows in the center and use a torch to 
                toast them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional, add a drizzle of hot fudge sauce on top and a sprinkle 
                of graham cracker crumbles to enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
