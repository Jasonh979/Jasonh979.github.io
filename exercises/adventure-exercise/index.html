        <p>
            The day started by waking up from my nice cozy bed from the sound 
            someone opening the fridge for there morning breakfast. After 
            getting up from the bed, getting to go potty, bark at the squirrel 
            that I see every morning to make sure he knows im still here, then 
            I go back into the house. I get some pets, and some treats when my 
            masters leave and now im home alone. What should a pup do?
