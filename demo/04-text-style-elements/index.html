        This text is not bold.
        <b>This text is bold.</b>
        <b> 
        This text is also bold.
        </b>

        Note how all this text is all on the same line. 

        That is because the &lt;b&gt; element is an <b>inline</b> element, 
        so regardless of how we format the code, it will ne on the same line 
        on the page (unless the line wraps).
