            This is a paragraph. Below is another paragraph with lorem ipsum 
            content.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            Note that each paragraph has it own margin on the top and bottom.
            This keeps them separate from each other on the page.
        </p>
        <p>While you can keep your paragraph content on one line of code 
            (like this one),</p>
        <p>
            Most of the time your going to have a lot of content in your 
            paragraphs, and it is generally good practice to break the text 
            content inside across muliple lines, so you don't have to scroll
            to the right to see it all.
